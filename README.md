## CHAT MODEL: A CONVERSATIONAL QUESTION ANSWERING MODEL in STREAMLIT

ðŸš€ ðŸš€  I just finished my SECOND project with my amazing mentor, SHARATH RAJU, where we built on the first simple project of building a SIMPLE QUESTION ANSWERING model in Streamlit and taking it NEXT LEVEL by incorporating a CONVERSATIONAL STYLE!! Pretty cool huh? ðŸ˜‰ 

In this project, we have BUILT ON the first project by incorporating features that would ALLOW the Chatbot to REMEMBER the conversation, exactly like ChatGPT. In fact, it's ChatGPT model that is doing all the work, but I find it pretty cool to see it in effect in a Streamlit environment ðŸ˜… . 

What are the benefits of using ChatGPT APIs instead of the interface we normally use on ChatGPT???

CUSTOMIZATION AND FINETUNING!! Building an application from APIs allow us to integrate AI-powered chat functionality directly into our applications, websites, or platforms. Definitely something I am doing when I start my OWN BUSINESSES. This will enable customization of the user experience to better fit specific use cases and branding requirements. We can also PRETRAIN the models on our own data before using them. 

We can see how the model remembers my name and what I am working on in this cute little streamlit application. Nothing fancy here I know... It's just the ideas of what can be done with this and how much MONEY it can save companies that fascinates me. For example, hundreds of VIRTUAL ASSISTANTS can be built from calling a SINGLE AI MIND......... to do all the work. ðŸ˜®
