# ChatModel
In this project, we have BUILT ON the first project by incorporating features that would ALLOW the Chatbot to REMEMBER the conversation, exactly like ChatGPT. In fact, it's ChatGPT model that is doing all the work, but I find it pretty cool to see it in effect in a Streamlit environment.
